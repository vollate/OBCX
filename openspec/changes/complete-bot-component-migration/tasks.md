## 1. Freeze the migration boundary

- [ ] 1.1 Add a production source inventory test covering every `IBot`, `IQQBot`, `ITelegramBot`, `ITelegramMediaGroupUploader`, `BotRegistry`, concrete bot, connection-factory, and live-bot RTTI use that must disappear
- [ ] 1.2 Add baseline conformance tests for OneBot WebSocket, OneBot HTTP, and Telegram HTTP startup, ingress, command publication, and shutdown behavior
- [ ] 1.3 Freeze the existing 13-action supported sets and provider success/error/submission-safety behavior before moving endpoint implementations
- [ ] 1.4 Add installed-SDK fixtures proving in-repository actors use only `BotOperationClient` and data-only operation contracts

- [ ] 3.8 Implement descriptor-only recipe assembly used by validation-only without sockets, threads, provider calls, or persistent state

## 4. Define reviewed installation recipes

- [ ] 6.7 Preserve Telegram provider envelope parsing, scoped chat/message results, authenticated URL confinement, byte bounds, and conservative side-effect safety
- [ ] 6.8 Add Telegram recipe tests for polling ingress, topics, media, optional upload, command catalogs, proxy/TLS errors, timeout cancellation, and shutdown

## 7. Cut operation dispatch over to native capabilities

- [ ] 7.1 Generalize/rename the QQ-Telegram dispatcher as needed so endpoint registration consumes native installation endpoint capabilities rather than live bot objects
- [ ] 7.2 Register composed endpoint capabilities by exact installation id and surface with duplicate and wrong-surface rejection
- [ ] 7.3 Preserve actor-facing `BotOperationClient`, all existing request/result DTOs, exact target validation, redaction, and the closed action matrix
- [ ] 7.4 Replace optional-interface action inference with explicit same-installation capability checks
- [ ] 7.5 Replace inherited fake bots in dispatcher tests with fake endpoint/protocol/transport components
- [ ] 7.6 Add architecture gates proving dispatcher and endpoint production code has no live-bot registry lookup, provider bot cast, or removed bot-header dependency

## 8. Migrate process startup, ingress, commands, and reload

- [ ] 8.1 Replace `ComponentManager` bot creation/setup in `main` with typed descriptor validation and `BotInstallationAssembler`
- [ ] 8.2 Register actor message and notice ingress subscriptions against each installation event capability before starting its transport

- [ ] 8.8 Add startup, validation-only, reload, in-flight operation, partial installation failure, and coordinated shutdown integration tests

## 9. Remove the legacy inheritance architecture

- [ ] 9.1 Migrate every remaining root and local-actor production consumer away from `IBot`, provider bot interfaces, concrete bots, and `BotRegistry`
- [ ] 9.2 Delete `QQBot`, `TGBot`, their headers/implementations, and Telegram's unsupported OneBot-shaped stub methods
- [ ] 9.3 Delete `IBot`, `IQQBot`, `ITelegramBot`, `ITelegramMediaGroupUploader`, and inherited fake/test implementations
- [ ] 9.4 Delete `BotRegistry`, `RegisteredBot`, live-bot operation wrapper construction, and all provider-interface RTTI paths
- [ ] 9.5 Delete or replace the misleading singleton `ComponentManager`, `ConnectionManagerFactory`, unsupported `TelegramWebsocket`, and unknown-type fallback behavior
- [ ] 9.6 Remove obsolete universal protocol/connection base interfaces where they only exist to support bot-type downcasting, retaining only narrow component contracts with real substitution tests
- [ ] 9.7 Update CMake install/export lists and standalone SDK fixtures so removed compatibility headers are no longer shipped or linked
- [ ] 9.8 Strengthen the source inventory gate to fail on any reintroduction of god-bot inheritance, live-bot casts, registry access, or provider objects in actors

## 10. Migrate configuration and documentation

- [ ] 10.1 Convert every tracked root, development, test, packaging, and local-actor bot configuration to exact `surface`, explicit `transport`, `_ms` duration keys, and placeholder credentials
- [ ] 10.2 Remove tracked production-like bot tokens and access tokens, document that exposed credentials require operator-side rotation, and verify tests/logs never echo them
- [ ] 10.3 Document the component/capability/installation model, reviewed recipes, lifecycle ordering, actor boundary, and supported action matrix
- [ ] 10.4 Add an explicit legacy-to-canonical bot configuration migration table and binary/config rollback procedure
- [ ] 10.5 Update architecture docs that still instruct actors to resolve `IQQBot` or `ITelegramBot` so `BotOperationClient` is the sole supported actor bot API
- [ ] 10.6 Update changelog and breaking-change guidance for removal of legacy bot interfaces and strict configuration parsing

## 11. Validate the completed cutover

- [ ] 11.1 Run the full root build and test suite, including all recipe, operation, ingress, command, validation-only, reload, and shutdown tests
- [ ] 11.2 Run installed-SDK and every repository under `local_actor/` from clean builds and verify no removed compatibility dependency remains
- [ ] 11.3 Run ASan/TSan or the repository's equivalent concurrency/lifetime suites for component startup rollback, in-flight shutdown, reconnect, polling, and executor destruction
- [ ] 11.4 Run clang-tidy on the changed core component/configuration code and resolve actionable analyzer, lifetime, cast, optional-access, and special-member diagnostics
- [ ] 11.5 Run `nix fmt` from the repository root and verify the root plus every `local_actor/` repository is formatted
- [ ] 11.6 Run strict OpenSpec validation and verify all proposal, design, specification, architecture, source-inventory, and credential checks pass
